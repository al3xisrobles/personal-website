These instruments generate large spectral and imaging datasets ripe for analyses with the aid of artificial neural networks. Machine learning methods facilitate autonomous rover decision-making on Mars, and improve and expedite scientific analysis on Earth, saving valuable mission resources. My team presents a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and its standardized training dataset as a quick and accurate means of rock and mineral classification using images and spectra, either separately or in conjunction."
